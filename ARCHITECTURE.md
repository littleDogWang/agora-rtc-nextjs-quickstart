# Agora RTC Next.js Quickstart Architecture

## System Overview

This quickstart is a one-to-one browser calling application. Next.js serves the
UI and a request-scoped token route. Each browser owns its local media and one
Agora RTC Web SDK client. Agora carries audio and video between clients that
join the same room with different numeric UIDs.

## Component Topology

```text
Browser A                              Browser B
  | camera + microphone                 | camera + microphone
  | POST /api/token                     | POST /api/token
  v                                     v
Next.js application and token route (Node.js process)
  | reads server environment and issues scoped RTC publisher tokens
  v
Agora RTC channel: UUID room ID
  ^                                     ^
  | UID A: publish + subscribe           | UID B: publish + subscribe
  +-------------------------------------+
```

`app/page.tsx` renders room creation. `app/room/[roomId]/page.tsx` accepts only a
canonical lowercase UUID and mounts `components/room-experience.tsx`.

## Request And Media Flow

1. The home page creates a UUID room URL.
2. The room experience imports `agora-rtc-sdk-ng` in the browser and requests
   camera and microphone access using the system-selected devices by default.
3. Pre-join exposes the room URL for invitation. Manual device selection remains
   available behind settings, and the user explicitly selects **Join Call**.
4. The browser calls `POST /api/token` with the room ID. The server validates the
   UUID, creates a positive numeric UID, and returns App ID, room ID, UID, token,
   and relative expiration under `Cache-Control: no-store`.
5. `RtcSession` registers Agora event handlers before joining, joins with the
   returned room ID and UID, and publishes every available local track.
6. `user-published` is handled independently for audio and video. The client
   subscribes before playing audio or rendering video.
7. Before token expiry, the client requests a new token with the same room ID
   and numeric UID and calls `renewToken`.
8. Cleanup unregisters listeners, unpublishes local tracks, stops and closes
   every owned track, and leaves the channel. Cleanup is idempotent.

## Ownership Boundaries

- `components/room-experience.tsx` owns device initialization and the `loading`,
  `prejoin`, `joining`, `connected`, `error`, and `left` UI phases.
- `lib/media-devices.ts` owns local track creation, switching, enablement,
  device-change listeners, and track release.
- `app/api/token/route.ts` owns the HTTP request and response contract.
- `lib/token.ts` owns RTC publisher token construction and expiration.
- `lib/rtc-session.ts` owns the Agora client, events, publish/subscribe, renewal,
  and session cleanup.
- Agora owns channel transport and remote media delivery. The application has no
  room database or persistent session service.

## Authentication And Secrets

`NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` is the public Agora project identifier.
`NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` is server-only and is read only by the token route.
It must not be returned, logged, bundled, copied into an image, or committed.

Tokens use `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithUid`, `RtcRole.PUBLISHER`, and a
3600-second relative token and privilege expiration. Token, join, and renewal
must use the same room ID and numeric UID.

## RTC Lifecycle

There is exactly one `RtcSession` per mounted room session. Event handlers are
registered before join so existing publications are not missed. Audio and video
publication events remain separate. A missing camera or microphone does not
block the other available media type. Device changes refresh the available list;
manual selection is optional and does not block the default join path.

## Runtime Modes

### Local Development

`pnpm dev` runs Next.js on `http://localhost:3000`. Localhost may access media
devices without HTTPS. `.env.local` supplies the two Agora values to the server
process. Node.js 22.x and 24.x are supported; Docker uses Node.js 22 as the
reference production runtime.

### Vercel

Vercel serves the frontend and request-scoped App Router token route. Both
environment variables are configured in the Vercel project. The resulting demo
is public unless access controls are added.

### Docker

The multi-stage image builds Next.js `standalone` output and runs `server.js` as
a non-root user on port 3000. The public App ID is supplied at build time and
must match the runtime value. Both variables are supplied to the container at
runtime; the certificate is never a build argument.

The container is stateless. It does not store rooms, users, media, or tokens.

## API And External Contracts

`POST /api/token` accepts JSON `{ "roomId": string, "uid"?: number }`.
Successful responses contain `appId`, `roomId`, `uid`, `token`, and `expiresIn`.
Malformed JSON or invalid identifiers return 400. Missing credentials or token
construction failures return a generic 500 response. All responses are
non-cacheable.

The external runtime dependencies are Agora RTC Web SDK `4.24.3` and
`agora-token` `2.0.5`.

## Production Boundary

This repository is a development quickstart, not a production token service. It
has no application login, room authorization, server-controlled user identity,
rate limiting, abuse controls, monitoring, RTM, AI agent, recording, screen
sharing, or persistence. Production deployments must add the controls required
by their threat model.
