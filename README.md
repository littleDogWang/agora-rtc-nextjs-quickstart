# Agora RTC Next.js Quickstart

A one-to-one audio and video calling starter built with Next.js and the Agora
RTC Web SDK. Create a room, check your devices, join from one client, then open
the same room URL from another independent client for complete RTC media.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x or 24.x (both tested in CI; Node 22 is the default in `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm 9.15.9
- An Agora project with an App ID and primary App Certificate
- A supported browser with camera and microphone permission for live RTC
- Docker for the container workflow

## Run It

```bash
pnpm install
cp env.local.example .env.local
```

Set both Agora values in `.env.local`, then run:

```bash
pnpm run doctor
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), select **Create Room**,
copy the invite link, confirm the automatically selected devices, and select
**Join Call**. Manual device selection is available from **Select devices**.

## Working From A Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/littleDogWang/agora-rtc-nextjs-quickstart.git
cd agora-rtc-nextjs-quickstart
pnpm install
cp env.local.example .env.local
```

Add credentials to `.env.local`, run `pnpm run doctor`, and start with
`pnpm dev`. The repository does not create or bind an Agora project for you.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Owner | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` | Yes | Public project configuration | Agora project identifier returned to the browser with its RTC token. |
| `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` | Yes | Next.js server only | Secret used by `POST /api/token`; never expose, log, bundle, or bake it into an image. |

Local development reads `.env.local`. Vercel uses project environment
variables. Docker receives the public App ID at build and runtime and the App
Certificate only at runtime.

## Use The Quickstart

### Single-client success

On the pre-join screen, copy the invite link, choose the initial microphone and
camera state, and select **Join Call**. The browser and Agora SDK use the system
devices by default; open **Select devices** only when a manual choice is needed.
A successful single-client run:

- issues an RTC token;
- joins the generated room with a numeric UID;
- publishes every available local media track;
- keeps local preview and controls active; and
- shows **Waiting for another participant**.

Single-client join is supported, but it does not prove remote media.

### Complete one-to-one experience

Open the exact same room URL in a second tab, window, browser profile, or device.
Complete pre-join and join independently in each client. Complete RTC success
requires two different UIDs and actual remote audio and video receipt in both
directions.

When testing twice on one computer:

- wear headphones or mute one microphone to avoid feedback;
- turn one camera off if the device cannot serve two browser contexts; and
- confirm both clients use the same `/room/<room-id>` URL.

## What You Get

- Next.js App Router UI matching the Agora agent starter visual shell
- pre-join preview with automatic devices and optional manual selection
- visible invite actions before join and while waiting for a participant
- microphone and camera controls during the call
- direct `agora-rtc-sdk-ng` join, publish, subscribe, renewal, and cleanup
- URL-only UUID rooms with no database
- server-generated RTC publisher tokens
- single-client waiting and two-participant call states
- responsive desktop and mobile layouts
- Vercel and Docker production paths

## How It Works

The home page creates a UUID room URL. The room initializes available local
media from system defaults, exposes the room URL for invitation, and does not
join until the user acts. `POST /api/token` validates the room, creates or reuses
a numeric UID, and returns a non-cacheable RTC token.
The browser registers events, joins, publishes local tracks, and subscribes to
remote audio and video independently. Token renewal reuses the same room and UID.
Leaving releases listeners, tracks, devices, and the RTC client.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the canonical topology and lifecycle.

## Commands

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install           # install the locked dependency graph
pnpm run doctor        # check Node, pnpm, required files, and local env values
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev               # Next.js development server
pnpm run start         # start an existing production build
pnpm run test:watch    # Vitest watch mode
```

### Quality

```bash
pnpm run lint          # ESLint
pnpm run typecheck     # TypeScript without emit
pnpm test              # unit and component tests
pnpm run build         # production build
```

### CI / Pre-ship

```bash
pnpm run verify        # lint + typecheck + test + build
```

## Architecture

The browser owns UI state, local devices, and one RTC client. The Next.js Node
process owns token generation and the App Certificate. Agora owns channel and
media transport. The application has no room database or persistent backend.

Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for component, API, lifecycle, Vercel,
Docker, and production boundaries.

## Repository Map

- `app/api/token/route.ts` - RTC token issue and renewal route
- `app/room/[roomId]/page.tsx` - validated room entry
- `components/room-experience.tsx` - pre-join and call state machine
- `components/pre-join.tsx` - local device setup
- `components/invite-button.tsx` - shared invitation copy and feedback
- `components/call-view.tsx` - one-to-one call layout
- `lib/rtc-session.ts` - Agora client lifecycle
- `lib/media-devices.ts` - partial media and device handling
- `tests/` - token, RTC, device, and UI contracts
- `docs/ai/` - progressive coding-agent context
- `AGENTS.md` - coding-agent loading and implementation constraints

## Troubleshooting

- **Credentials are not configured:** confirm both `.env.local` values are non-empty, then restart Next.js.
- **Camera or microphone permission was denied:** allow the site in browser permissions and retry device setup.
- **Only one media type works:** audio-only or video-only join is supported when one device is unavailable.
- **No remote video:** confirm both clients use the same room URL and the remote camera is enabled.
- **No remote audio:** confirm the remote microphone is enabled and browser playback is not muted.
- **Two local tabs cannot use the camera:** turn off one camera or use another browser or device.
- **Container starts but RTC fails:** verify build-time and runtime App IDs match and runtime credentials are real; HTTP startup alone is not RTC evidence.

## Deployment

### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FlittleDogWang%2Fagora-rtc-nextjs-quickstart&project-name=agora-rtc-nextjs-quickstart&repository-name=agora-rtc-nextjs-quickstart&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID%2CNEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE&envDescription=Agora+credentials+needed+to+run+the+RTC+quickstart&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FlittleDogWang%2Fagora-rtc-nextjs-quickstart%23run-it&demo-title=Agora+RTC+Next.js+Quickstart&demo-description=One-to-one+audio+and+video+calling+with+Agora+RTC+and+Next.js)

The Vercel account must have repository access. Configure both environment
variables, deploy, verify single-client join, then use two independent clients
for complete media evidence.

### Docker

Build with the public App ID:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID=your_app_id \
  --tag agora-rtc-nextjs-quickstart .
```

Run with the same App ID and the server-only certificate:

```bash
docker run --rm --publish 3000:3000 \
  --env NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID=your_app_id \
  --env NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=your_app_certificate \
  agora-rtc-nextjs-quickstart
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Image build, process startup, and HTTP availability
prove packaging only; they do not prove RTC token validity or media.

## Security

The App Certificate remains server-side and token responses are non-cacheable.
The token route validates room IDs and UIDs but has no application login, room
authorization, server-controlled identity, or rate limiting.

Use a dedicated demo project. Do not attach production credentials to untrusted
preview environments. Remove public demos and rotate the App Certificate when
they are no longer needed. Production use requires authentication,
authorization, abuse controls, and monitoring.
