> Security model, secrets, authentication, trust boundaries, and mitigations.

## Trust Boundaries

The browser is untrusted and owns local devices and RTC media. The Next.js server
owns token construction and the App Certificate. Agora receives scoped token,
channel, UID, and media traffic. Vercel or the Docker host owns runtime env values.

## Secrets

`NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` is server-only. Keep it out of Git, logs,
screenshots, responses, browser bundles, Docker contexts, image layers, and
untrusted previews. Use a dedicated demo project and rotate after exposure or
when a public demo is removed.

## Authentication And Authorization

Tokens use validated UUID room IDs, positive cross-platform-safe numeric UIDs,
publisher role, and 3600-second relative expiration. The demo has no application
login, room authorization, server-controlled identity, or rate limiting.

## Input And Output Handling

The token route rejects malformed JSON and invalid room/UID input. Responses are
non-cacheable and server failures are generic. Do not add credential values to
errors, telemetry, or UI state.

## Security Reporting

Report vulnerabilities privately through an approved GitHub security or
maintainer contact channel. Do not publish credentials or exploit details in an issue.

## Related Deep Dives

None.
