# 06 Interfaces

> API, event, environment, and external service contracts.

## Browser Or User-Facing APIs

`POST /api/token` accepts `{ roomId: string, uid?: number }`. Success returns
`appId`, `roomId`, `uid`, `token`, and `expiresIn`. Invalid JSON, room ID, or UID
returns 400. Missing configuration or token failure returns a generic 500. Every
response uses `Cache-Control: no-store`.

## Events And Media

`RtcSession` handles `user-joined`, `user-published`, `user-unpublished`,
`user-left`, `connection-state-change`, token expiry warnings, and `exception`.
Audio and video publications arrive independently. Remote audio is played after
subscription; remote video is exposed to the view after subscription.

## Environment Contract

`NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` is the public project identifier.
`NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` is server-only. Docker requires the public App ID at
build and both values at runtime; the certificate is never a build argument.

## External Services

- Agora RTC Web SDK `4.24.3`
- `agora-token` `2.0.5`
- Agora RTC channel service

The runtime assumes token authentication and network access to Agora services.
