# 05 Workflows

> Common development, modification, deployment, and diagnosis workflows.

## First Success

Install, copy the environment example, add credentials, run doctor, start the
app, create a room, copy its invite link, and join with the automatically selected
devices. Use settings only when manual device selection is needed. For complete
RTC success, join the exact room from a second independent client and verify audio
and video receipt both ways.

## Modify The RTC Core Flow

Inspect `lib/rtc-session.ts`, `lib/token.ts`, the token route, and their tests.
Preserve the RTC invariants, add focused tests, run `pnpm run verify`, and update
ARCHITECTURE, RECIPE, interfaces, gotchas, and security as affected.

## Modify The Client Or UI

Edit `components/` and `app/`, preserve explicit join and device cleanup, update
component tests and screenshots when stale, then run the canonical verification.

## Change An Interface

Update the owner, browser client, contract tests, README, ARCHITECTURE, RECIPE,
and `06_interfaces.md` in one local change.

## Deploy

For Vercel, configure both environment values and verify the deployed workflow.
For Docker, build with the public App ID, run with both runtime values, verify
HTTP startup, then perform RTC checks separately with real credentials.

## Diagnose A Failure

Identify the exact client, room, UID, timestamp, phase, and media direction.
Separate environment, HTTP/token, join, publish, subscribe, playback, and cleanup
evidence before naming a cause. Do not use health or static checks as media proof.
