# 02 Architecture

> System topology, data flow, and lifecycle overview.

## Components

- Next.js App Router pages and API route
- React client components for pre-join and call state
- Agora RTC Web SDK browser client
- server-side `agora-token` builder
- Agora RTC channel transport

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the canonical topology.

## Data And Event Flow

The browser initializes available local media from system-selected devices and
exposes the room URL for invitation. After an explicit join action it requests a
scoped token, registers events, joins, publishes local tracks, and subscribes to
audio and video independently. Renewal reuses room and UID. Cleanup unregisters,
unpublishes, stops, closes, and leaves.

## Ownership Boundaries

`components/room-experience.tsx` owns UI phases, `lib/media-devices.ts` owns
devices, `app/api/token/route.ts` and `lib/token.ts` own credentials, and
`lib/rtc-session.ts` owns the RTC client lifecycle. Agora owns media transport.

## Runtime Modes

- local development: `pnpm dev` on localhost
- local or hosted production: Next.js build and Node process
- Vercel: frontend plus request-scoped token route
- Docker: stateless standalone server on port 3000 with runtime environment
