# Quickstart Recipe Profile

## Recipe Role

- Role: `base` RTC Web quickstart recipe.
- Target audience: developers establishing first one-to-one RTC success in Next.js.
- Reuse model: clone, configure, run, verify, then customize documented extension points.

## Recipe Scope

The baseline creates UUID room URLs, prepares partial local media, issues
server-side RTC publisher tokens, joins and publishes on explicit user action,
subscribes to remote audio and video, renews tokens, and releases resources.

## Baseline Implementation Guidance

Treat this repository's source and [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) as the
baseline. Preserve the direct RTC SDK lifecycle, token route, environment names,
room identity, command semantics, and evidence levels. Do not recreate join or
token behavior from memory.

## Extension Points

- `ui-experience`: change `components/` and `app/` presentation while preserving
  explicit join, stable media tiles, lifecycle ownership, and UI tests. Run the
  affected component tests and `pnpm run verify`.
- `application-access-control`: add login, room authorization, identity, role,
  rate limiting, and abuse controls around `app/api/token/route.ts`. Update token
  tests, README, ARCHITECTURE, interfaces, security, and deployment docs.

## Invariants

- `server-only-certificate`: only the Next.js server reads `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`.
- `rtc-identity-consistency`: token issue, join, and renewal use one room ID and numeric UID.
- `rtc-resource-cleanup`: register handlers before join; unpublish, stop, close, and leave during idempotent cleanup.
- Audio and video publication events are independent.
- One missing media device does not block the other available media type.

## Stable Contracts

- `POST /api/token` accepts `{ roomId, uid? }` and returns `appId`, `roomId`, `uid`, `token`, and `expiresIn` under `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- `.env.local` uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` and server-only `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`.
- `pnpm run verify` is the canonical lint, typecheck, test, and build command.
- Docker runs standalone Next.js on port 3000 and never bakes the certificate into the image.

## Internal / Subject To Change

Component composition, CSS, local phase representation, device-list rendering,
and helper function boundaries may change when their owned contracts and tests
remain satisfied.

## Consumer Onboarding Recipe

```bash
pnpm install
cp env.local.example .env.local
pnpm run doctor
pnpm dev
```

Join once for the supported single-client state. Then use the exact same room URL
from a second independent client and verify audio and video receipt both ways.
Run `pnpm run verify` before shipping a customization.
