# Agent Development Guide

This repository is the Agora RTC Web one-to-one quickstart for Next.js.

## How To Load

1. Read [docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md](docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md).
2. Read [docs/ai/RECIPE.md](docs/ai/RECIPE.md).
3. Load all eight files in [docs/ai/L1/](docs/ai/L1/).
4. Follow [docs/ai/L1/L2/_index.md](docs/ai/L1/L2/_index.md) only when a task needs a listed deep dive.
5. Use [README.md](README.md) for user workflows and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for canonical topology and lifecycle.

## Current System Shape

- Next.js App Router and React
- direct `agora-rtc-sdk-ng` integration; do not add `agora-rtc-react`
- server-side RTC token generation through `POST /api/token`
- URL-only room identity with no room database
- one browser-owned RTC client per mounted room session
- Vercel and standalone Docker production modes

## Supported Modes

- local development with `pnpm dev`
- local production with `pnpm run build && pnpm run start`
- Vercel frontend plus request-scoped token route
- Docker standalone Next.js process on port 3000

## Routing / Ownership

- UI and interaction state: `components/`
- validated room route: `app/room/[roomId]/page.tsx`
- HTTP token contract: `app/api/token/route.ts`
- RTC token construction: `lib/token.ts`
- browser token client: `lib/token-client.ts`
- RTC lifecycle: `lib/rtc-session.ts`
- device and local-track ownership: `lib/media-devices.ts`
- room and UID validation: `lib/room-id.ts`
- behavior contracts: `tests/`

## Key Files

- `components/room-experience.tsx` - device initialization and room UI phases
- `components/pre-join.tsx` - local preview and initial device state
- `components/call-view.tsx` - waiting and peer-present call layout
- `app/api/token/route.ts` - initial token and same-UID renewal
- `lib/rtc-session.ts` - join, publish, subscribe, renew, and cleanup
- `scripts/doctor.mjs` - local runtime and environment checks
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - canonical runtime and ownership model
- `docs/ai/RECIPE.md` - extension points, invariants, and stable contracts

## Patterns And Anti-Patterns

- Keep RTC imports in client code and App Certificate reads in server code.
- Extend existing ownership boundaries instead of duplicating RTC clients or token builders.
- Keep room identity in the URL; do not add persistence without an explicit scope decision.
- Keep visible UI copy operational and use Lucide icons for familiar controls.
- Do not treat build, HTTP, token issue, or single-client join as remote media proof.

## RTC Invariants

1. Keep `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` server-side only. Never return, log, screenshot, or bundle it.
2. Generate RTC-only tokens with `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithUid` and `RtcRole.PUBLISHER`.
3. Pass relative `3600` seconds for token and privilege expiration. Do not pass an epoch timestamp.
4. Use the same `roomId` and numeric `uid` for token generation, `client.join`, and renewal.
5. Register client event handlers before `client.join`.
6. Handle `user-published` independently for audio and video, subscribing before playback.
7. Keep exactly one RTC client per mounted room session and make cleanup idempotent.
8. Unpublish tracks, then call `stop()` and `close()` on each local track, then leave the channel.
9. A missing camera or microphone must not block the other available media type.
10. Do not add RTM, chat, AI agents, recording, screen sharing, authentication, or persistence without an explicit scope decision.

## UI Contract

- The current `agent-quickstart-nextjs` rendered UI is the first visual reference.
- Preserve its cool page background, dark interaction surface, Agora cyan CTA, Lucide icon style, in-call header, and Powered by Agora attribution.
- Keep local and remote video tile dimensions stable between waiting and peer-present states.
- Use icons and tooltips for familiar call controls. Keep visible text operational, not tutorial copy.
- Update README screenshots whenever material UI changes make existing evidence stale.

## Testing

Mock `agora-rtc-sdk-ng` at the owned module/client boundary. Tests must cover:

- correct room and UID on join;
- local track publication;
- independent audio and video subscription;
- token renewal before expiry;
- device switching and partial media failures;
- cleanup ordering and idempotency; and
- single-client waiting and two-participant UI states.

Do not mark implementation work complete without tests.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run doctor
pnpm dev
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm run build
pnpm run verify
```

Docker commands and environment ownership are documented in README.

## Verification Safety

- Lint, typecheck, unit tests, and build may use obviously synthetic credentials.
- Docker build, startup, and HTTP smoke may use synthetic credentials and prove packaging only.
- A browser join requires real credentials, network access, and device permission.
- Complete RTC success requires two independent clients with different UIDs in the same room and observed audio and video receipt in both directions.
- Never print, commit, screenshot, or bake a real App Certificate into an image.

## Done Criteria

1. Run the narrowest relevant test.
2. Run `pnpm run verify` for shipped changes.
3. Build and start the production image when runtime or packaging can change.
4. Update README, ARCHITECTURE, AGENTS, RECIPE, and affected L1 docs when their contracts change.
5. State static, packaging, single-client, and complete RTC evidence separately.

## Git Conventions

- Use conventional commits: `type: description` or `type(scope): description`.
- Use lowercase, present-tense descriptions.
- Do not add AI attribution trailers.
- Do not use `--no-verify`.
- A request to edit does not authorize commit, push, or another remote write.

## Documentation Synchronization

When a route, environment key, lifecycle rule, UI workflow, success condition,
or deployment boundary changes, update its owning document and every summary
that links to it. Keep README, ARCHITECTURE, RECIPE, affected L1 files, tests,
CI, and Docker behavior consistent.

## Deployment Boundary

Vercel and Docker deployments are public development demos unless application
access controls are added. The token route has no login, room authorization, or
rate limiting. Never describe it as a production token service. Production use
requires authentication, room authorization, server-controlled identity and
role, abuse controls, and monitoring.
